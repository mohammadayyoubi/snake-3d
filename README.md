<h1>Snake-3D</h1>
<h3>A simple classic Snake3D game made with unity 5.3</h3>

The snake starts with 3 pieces and increase one piece for each fruit eaten.

A new fruit will appear in a random place with particles effect and sound effect every time the snake eats it, and there are 2 types of fruits int the game. The number of fruit pieces can be changed by the user.
There are a number of rocks as obstacles and can also be determined by the user. The sanke dies in one of 3 cases:

- Hitting the border
- Hitting an obstacle
- Hitting itself

The snake moves in 4 directions (ie. 4 angles) and the movement can be done with arrow keys, mouse swiping or touch swiping for mobile phones using swipe manager script (link below).
The main menu is very simple with start button. Afetr clicking start a loading text appears for a couple of seconds until the game loading is finished.
There are also some plant 3D models to simulate a garden and the game plane has a grass material sourrounded by 4 walls and the snake has a snake texture to simulate a real snake.

I have implemented a new feature in which the player can change the camera position with 3 modes:
- close (like fps)

- middle

- far

And the pause button enables the player to pause the game at any time.
After the snake dies the lose scene will be loaded showing the score of the player and a play again button which load the main menu again.

The game is suitable for mobile phones and was tested on some devices like (Galaxy S3, Galaxy S5, Note 4)
